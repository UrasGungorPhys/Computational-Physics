    "## Revision of systems of linear equations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification of linear systems\n",
    "Any equation that contains -at most- 1st power of its variables is called a linear equation (e.g., $3x + 5y = 1$ is a _linear equation_ whereas $3x^2 + 5\\sqrt y$ isn't (it is a _non-linear equation_)). If we have more than one linear equation, then we are working on a linear system. Depending on the number of <u>independent</u> equations ($n_e$) and the number of variables ($n_v$) our linear system will belong to one of these three classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Underdetermined linear system**  \n",
    "When the number of the variables ($n_v$) is greater than the number of equations ($n_e$) there will be infinite solutions. Consider the equation: $x - y = 5$ in this case any one of the pairs (-3.4, -8.4), (5,0), (6.2,1.2), (7,2), ... will satisfy the equation.\n",
    "2. **Independent linear system**  \n",
    "When we have $n_v = n_e$ then there is one and only one solution set, i.e., the equation will be satisfied for exactly one value of each variable. For example: $x - 3 = 5$ is satisfied only when $x=8$, likewise $3x + 2y = 8\\: \\&\\:x - y = 1$ equations are _simultaneously_ satisfied only for (x,y) = (2,1) values.\n",
    "3. **Overdetermined linear system**  \n",
    "When $n_v$ < $n_e$ we have an overdetermined system where there is no solution. This kind of systems usually appear in experimental measurings. Suppose that the weight with respect to mass is measured for a specific mass. From Newton's 2nd equation: $F_g = mg$, so, we would expect to find the same reading, however, there will be a discrepancy regarding the measured weights. So, even though we have the same value for m, and fixed value for g, their product manifestation will differ a little bit for each measurement. We usually take the average of these values to transform an overdetermined linear system into an independent linear system."
