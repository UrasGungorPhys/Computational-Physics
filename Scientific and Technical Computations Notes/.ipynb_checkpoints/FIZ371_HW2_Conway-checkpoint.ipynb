    "If we try to divide the players up into groups of three, and match the player in the \"middle\" of the group against the \"left\" and \"right\" players to pick the strongest of the three (this could happen after one player beats the other two, or one player beats one player, then the other player beats the player who beat that first player, making them likely to be stronger than the first player who has lost as well) and lead the stronger players to the next round, we get to eliminate a third of the competition in one \"step\" of the algorithm.\n",

Each group had to play two matches back to back, resulting in the player number dropping to 333, meaning we had to wait through 2 matches to eliminate 666 players. For comparison, in the natural winners play winners approach, we only had to wait through only one match, and the player number already dropped down to less than half, since we chose to eliminate both the losers and the drawers."

After a few matches, say 3, we would eliminate all the players who haven't won all three of their matches, and keep matching randomly until either one player develops a big enough lead to become the winner, or we get a smaller group of players that we can then match up against eachother in the \"finals\". So basically, players play matches back to back and get cut off if they haven't made it to a certain score.\n",

    "We couldn't find a solid proof as to what class this is because all classes are spesifically stated for 1D cellular automata on the web so we are making an educated-guess based on what we've learned. So far we know that the classification of cellular automata is based on random initial conditions. If the system converges to a \"simple\" steady state regardless of the initial conditions, it is classified as class 1, which is not the case here, since even with a small number of cells alive initially, there will be no one basic pattern to which it collapses to.  - Of all the possible 2D patterns it seems like the easiest one to spot as class 1 the Moore Neighborhood 0 pattern -\n",
